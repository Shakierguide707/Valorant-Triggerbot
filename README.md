# Download of the latest version:

Due to an update to Valorant (which causes all mouse input to be ignored) versions 2.2 and below no longer work!

# Installation Version 2.3 - 2.4:
  
1. For the Valorant Triggerbot it is absolutely necessary to start the file in admin mode! 
  (To start the Valorant TriggerBot in admin mode, start PowerShell in admin mode 
  (Right click on the Windows Start button and select "Windows PowerShell (Administrator)". 
  Then write in PowerShell: "start " + full path of the file + ".jar".
  In case you get an error even though you're sure you wrote everything correctly, rename the file.)
2. In the Valorant crosshair settings it is important that you use a crosshair without a center or import the crosshair code below into valorant for example!
3. Set "o" as secondary key to shoot in Valorant's settings!

Only contact me if there is a real problem with the bot. Do not contact me if there is a problem with Java!

In case you get an error when you start the program (with: Java(TM) Platform SE binary), download this Java version https://www.techspot.com/downloads/7407-java-se-16.html

I am not responsible for the unlikely event of a ban!
