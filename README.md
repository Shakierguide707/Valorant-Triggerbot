  # ❗️ Instructions ❗️
  
Only contact me if there is a real problem with the bot. Do not contact me if there is a problem with Java!

In case you get an error when you start the program (with: Java(TM) Platform SE binary), download this Java version https://www.techspot.com/downloads/7407-java-se-16.html

I am not responsible for the unlikely event of a ban!
