Version 3.0 release date (estimate): 1.05.2023

Current possible errors:
1. Random shots
2. Program doesn't fire due to error in output

# Start Performance Version: 

1. Open cmd in Admin mode
2. Type: java -jar <Path of the File>.jar (Example: java -jar C:\Users\jonas\Desktop\PerformanceVersion.jar)
3. In the Valorant crosshair settings it is important that you use a crosshair without a center or import the crosshair code below into valorant for example!
4. Set "o" as secondary key to shoot in Valorant's settings!

# Start version 2.3 and newer:
  
1. For the Valorant Triggerbot it is absolutely necessary to start the file in admin mode! 
  (To start the Valorant TriggerBot in admin mode, start PowerShell in admin mode 
  (Right click on the Windows Start button and select "Windows PowerShell (Administrator)". 
  Then write in PowerShell: "start " + full path of the file + ".jar".
  In case you get an error even though you're sure you wrote everything correctly, rename the file.)
2. In the Valorant crosshair settings it is important that you use a crosshair without a center or import the crosshair code below into valorant for example!

  # ❗️ Instructions 
  
Only contact me if there is a real problem with the bot. Do not contact me if there is a problem with Java!

If you get an error when you start the program (with: Java(TM) Platform SE binary), download the Version 16.0.2 https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk16-archive-downloads.html

I am not responsible for the unlikely event of a ban!
