# Valorant-Soft-Aimbot

1. Copy the code and then paste it into an application like Eclipse (Java!)
2. For the Valorant Soft Aimbot it is absolutely necessary to start the executable in admin mode!
3. If you want the bot to work properly, it is important that you set the Valorant enemy color back to red if you have changed it!
4. In the Valorant crosshair settings it is important that you use a crosshair without a center! (At best, set the crosshairs to white!)
5. In order for you to be able to use the bot in scope (operator...) you need to enable advanced crosshair settings and set the thickness of the dot in the middle of the    scope to 0!
